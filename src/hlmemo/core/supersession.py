"""D-057 read-side temporal supersession for ``memory.query`` (PHASE2-4-ROADMAP W2b, query/2).

Two deterministic rules, applied after RRF fusion and the §4.9 dedupe:

1. **Linked supersession** (``db/librarian_queries.superseded_among``): when two hits are joined
   by a live ``supersedes`` link (applied — a proposal is only a question row), the superseded one
   is removed from the hits. It stays reachable through drilldown/raw and at a ``valid_at`` before
   the link's ``valid_from``.
2. **Newer first on an exact tie** (``newer_first_on_ties``): among hits with exactly the same
   fused score that are near-duplicates (same normalized title) and have different
   ``valid_from``, the newer one is ranked first. No other order changes, so G3 is untouched
   unless a fixture has exact-score, same-title pairs.
